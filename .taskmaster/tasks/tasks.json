For more complex scenarios, use a library like `react-lazyload` or similar.\n2.  **Image Optimization Pipeline:**\n    *   Implement an image optimization pipeline using tools like `sharp` or `imagemin` to compress images, generate WebP versions, and resize images for different screen sizes.\n    *   Serve optimized images based on the user's device and screen size using the `<picture>` element or `srcset` attribute.\n3.  **CDN Integration:** Integrate a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront to serve static assets (images, videos, JavaScript, CSS) from geographically distributed servers.\n4.  **Advanced Database Indexing:** Review and optimize database indexes to improve query performance. Add indexes to frequently queried columns and optimize existing indexes.\n5.  **Caching Strategies:**\n    *   Implement multi-layer caching: browser caching, CDN caching, server-side caching (e.g., using Redis or Memcached).\n    *   Use HTTP caching headers (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `Expires`) to control browser caching.\n6.  **Bundle Splitting:** Split the application's JavaScript bundles into smaller chunks to reduce the initial load time. Use code splitting with dynamic imports.\n7.  **Code Splitting:** Implement code splitting to load only the necessary code for each route or component. Use dynamic imports for components that are not immediately needed.\n8.  **Service Worker Caching:** Implement a service worker to cache static assets and enable offline functionality. Use the service worker to cache API responses for faster loading.\n9.  **Performance Monitoring:**\n    *   Integrate a performance monitoring tool like Google Analytics, Sentry, or New Relic to track key performance metrics (e.g., page load time, Time to Interactive, First Contentful Paint).\n    *   Set up alerts for performance regressions.\n10. **Lighthouse Optimization:** Run Lighthouse audits to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
